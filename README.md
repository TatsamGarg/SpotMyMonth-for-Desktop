# SpotMyMonth for Desktop
App to generate monthly Spotify playlists from your liked songs.

## Instructions

1. This program was written as a fun experiment to test how far someone with little to no experience in API development can get with assistance from ChatGPT. Turns out, quite far. This program goes through your ‘liked songs’ in your Spotify account and creates playlists for each month in the specified range of months. The playlists are populated with the songs you liked during the corresponding month. This is just meant to track your personal evolving taste in music, and if you like to associate different tastes in music with different phases of life, this will help you organise your library for that.

2. The program can not overwrite objects. So, in principle, it should not be able to ‘mess up’ or delete your data. I’m still very much an amateur, so do expect bugs. 

3. You will be asked to enter the ‘start’ and ‘end’ month, as well as your username. The program selects months INCLUDING the end month. So, for instance, if you want to make a playlist only for Feb23, you would enter - Feb/2023 to Feb/2023. 

4. You’re advised to enter only one month in your first try to make sure the program works for you, and doesn’t mess with your Spotify. If all’s good, just re-enter a larger range.

5. After clicking ‘generate playlists’, you will be redirected to Spotify to sign in to your account. If you’re already logged in from your computer, it will do this automatically for that account. 

6. IMPORTANT: Since this app is currently in a ‘development’ phase, you must inform me prior to usage. I will have to manually give your Spotify account access to the program through Spotify’s developer platform.
